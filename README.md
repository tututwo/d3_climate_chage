# Climate Change Visualization

The purpose is to use processed data from credible sources like Berkeley Earth and World Bank to demostrate the fact that global warming has been existing and is getting severe.

This website was created to fulfill the requirements of [Math W82: Data Visualization with D3](https://rpruim.github.io/D3/projects/) at Calvin University, January 2020.‚Äù  You can view the map [here](https://tututwo.github.io/Climate_Change.github.io/).

## Dataset
The CO2 emission dataset is found from [World Bank](http://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?downloadformat=csv) and processed by *peter-stuart-turner* on [his Github](https://github.com/peter-stuart-turner/time-series-analyses-and-climate-change/blob/master/processed_data/global_co2_emissions_per_capita.csv). The rest of processed global temperature datasets are from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) and was originally from [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/data/).
